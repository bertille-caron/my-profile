		<h2>My plan for my professional future 🌐</h2>
		<p> I would like to work in the media sector or in a communication agency as Press Relations Manager. These are inspiring and continuously developing fields. I have always wanted to mix the artistic spirit with its commercial context.I would particularly like to work in a "young" and dynamic company highlighting cooperative and collaborative work. </p>

		<h2>Centres of interest 🎨</h2>
		<p> I am fascinated by the new media. I follow a lot of programmes, documentaries and web pages dealing with subjects as varied as music, fashion, popular culture in the broadest sense or even politics. I'm curious and always on the lookout for new trends. I am also creative with a taste for art. Indeed, I love to make exhibitions and visit museums. I have the ability to put together artistic projects (manuals, photos, videos, montages). </p>
